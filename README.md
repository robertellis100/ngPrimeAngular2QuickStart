# ngPrime QuickerStart using Angular 2 QuickStart
Follow these steps to create your app with the rich features of ngPrime and Angular2. 
This repo came about from my persistent search for an effective table (sortable & filterable) that I could use quickly with the Angular2 QuickStart.

## Clone this repository
```bash
git clone  https://github.com/robertellis100/ngPrimeAngular2QuickStart  my-proj
cd my-proj
rm -rf .git
```
  Create your own repo

## Install npm packages described in the `package.json`
```bash
npm install
```
**Attention Windows Developers:  You must run all of these commands in administrator mode**

## Run compiler and server at same time, in "watch mode"
```bash
npm start
```
## Edit/Add code for ngPrime directives
 For example, create a responsive data table that sorts & filters with a paginator.
 See the following two resources:
   - My [ngPrimeTableTest1 repo](https://github.com/robertellis100/ngPrimeTableTest1) for a ReadMe on how I implemented the features in a test case.
   - ngPrime [DataTable page](http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable). Check out all the different features you can add to your table.
 Also, notice that there is a great amount items to use from ngPrime, not just tables.
 
## Begin your creation!
 You'll need to build out your app and add services to get the most from Angular 2. If you are unfamiliar with Angular 2 or want to learn more about a certain aspect, see [angular.io](https://angular.io/)
 If you a json file test in your data table. The cars-medium.json file is included in the folder app/resources/data. 

## Notes:
This repo is intended to increase the speed at which you can create Angular2 apps with the features of ngPrime. 
Therefore, you can skip the ngPrime [Setup](http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/setup).
And also skip the [Angular2 QuickStart](https://github.com/angular/quickstart/blob/master/README.md).

This repo is a clone of my [repo ang2TableProj6](https://github.com/robertellis100/ang2TableProj6). 
The details for how Angular2 QuickStart and the ngPrime Setup were combined are included in that ReadMe.
This repo has a better name to help others searching for this answer to their Angular 2 development needs.
